# Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-09-07 09:48 BST_

This is the short entry point for current state and acceptance. Use the
[milestone readiness map](docs/planning/openforge-milestone-contract-fixture-readiness.md) for full
sequencing and the [request register](docs/planning/plum-duff-next-issue-tracking-register.md) for
durable requirements.

## Current state

- Tested implementation revision: `630bde854a76ef8551a677690a060c3cf167a55a` on `main`.
- Notification History alignment [#100](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/100) is corrected
  with focused local automated and rendered synthetic evidence; Will reports it “looks better”,
  while #100 remains open and no session/notification acceptance is inferred.
- Notification clearing acceptance [#99](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/99) is `BLOCKED`:
  no actionable notification exists. The established isolated persistence runner is self-cleaning
  and cannot leave a manual fixture alongside the canonical Next development server without a
  separate runtime/build handoff, which is outside this bounded correction.
- Login initiation is restored: **PROVEN locally**, the real control reaches Google's authorization
  flow. The Google callback/session and Will's renewed acceptance remain **UNVERIFIED**.
- Local runtime: web `http://localhost:3010`; API `http://127.0.0.1:8010`; local SQLite; required
  Google/session configuration present without exposing its values. At handoff both services are
  running in named detached terminal sessions; their prior unexplained stop cause remains unknown.
- Start/recover from the repository in two separate persistent Terminal tabs with `pnpm dev:api`
  and `pnpm dev:web`; stop only the applicable process with `Ctrl-C`. Check with `curl -f
  http://127.0.0.1:8010/healthz` and `curl -f http://localhost:3010/login`. Do not let disposable
  test teardown own or stop these normal sessions. See [#101](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/101).
- Hosted state: not deployed or tested in this batch. User acceptance remains pending below.

## Project plan

- Current: Notification History containment and peer-row alignment are complete locally; visual
  acceptance remains open and notification-clearing acceptance remains blocked by fixture access.
- Next selected work: Will checks the corrected toolbar; #99 resumes only after a safe actionable
  fixture can be made manually reachable without disturbing normal services.
- Deferred: durable notification history [#90](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/90),
  remaining numerical validation [#91](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/91), Google and
  hosted workbook acceptance [#94](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/94), stale-workbook
  merge design [#95](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/95), and secret rotation
  [#96](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/96).
- Next functional batch for review: shared-component correction for destination-sign financial
  digit rolling [#105](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/105), before bounded surface adoption.

## Features and issues

- Login/session: [#62](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/62) — implementation evidence is
  separate from the pending manual result.
- Notification clearing: `NOTIFICATION-FIX-001` retains prior local automated evidence, but manual
  acceptance is `BLOCKED` by the missing actionable fixture in [#99](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/99);
  source-independent history remains [#90](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/90).
- Notification filter layout: `NOTIFICATION-LAYOUT-001` is locally corrected at `630bde8`; [#100](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/100)
  stays open pending Will's recheck and remains related, not folded into, [#92](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/92).
- Retrospective composed-layout work remains partial under `UI-CONSISTENCY-001`; the visible
  unchecked surface list is in the [UI audit backlog](docs/agent-contracts/plum-duff-ui-audit-backlog.md).
- `FINANCIAL-MOTION-001` is captured in [#105](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/105):
  implementation and rollout coverage remain pending verification.
- Profit Boost and strict input: [#83](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/83) retains its
  full scope and is now assigned to M14; remaining cross-surface validation is [#91](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/91).
- Full current blockers and recent IDs are in the [canonical request register](docs/planning/plum-duff-next-issue-tracking-register.md).

## What changed

- [`630bde8`](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/commit/630bde854a76ef8551a677690a060c3cf167a55a): separates peer fields from the action row so Search,
  Type and Status align while actions wrap independently; prior containment/focus coverage remains.
- Tracking now includes local runtime handoff [#101](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/101),
  request-coverage recovery [#102](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/102), and deferred
  rebranding decision [#103](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/103). The previously
  unlinked Founder import baseline is preserved in [#104](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/104).
- This page is the navigation summary; Git commits and linked contracts/registers retain detailed
  history.

## What Will should test

Environment/revision: local `http://localhost:3010`, `630bde8`. Manual status: visual `NOT RUN`;
notification clearing `BLOCKED`.

1. Open `http://localhost:3010/notifications`. Confirm **Search Notifications**, **Type**, and
   **Status** share one aligned field row in both themes; tab through them and resize the page.
2. Notification clear/reload/sign-in acceptance is `BLOCKED`: no actionable test notification is
   currently available. Do not manufacture business activity; resume [#99](https://github.com/wolney8/OpenForge/issues/99)
   after a safe, persistent, isolated manual fixture is available.

Record each manual result as `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED`; automated results never replace Will's
result.
